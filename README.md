## Project Overview

### The Problem

Many undergraduates and graduates struggle to:

- **Track** internship applications across multiple platforms.
- **Verify** if internships are legit, open, or closed.
- **Prepare** competitive CVs and understand industry-specific interview expectations.
- **Access** mentorship and a community that shares real-time internship insights.

### Vision

To empower undergraduates, graduates, and career switchers with a single platform to track internships, prepare professionally, learn from peers, and gain mentorship — so no opportunity is missed due to poor visibility or lack of guidance.

## Key Features

### Tracking & Community

- **Internship Application Tracker:** Manage application status (Saved, Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected).
- **Search Functionality:** Search internships with filters for industry, location (Country, City, Remote/Hybrid), and **Visa Sponsorship**.
- **Community Hub:** Company-specific interview threads, and a Q&A forum with an upvote/flag system.
- **CV & Career Prep:** CV uploads, peer reviews, and an interview preparation library.
